I'd like to create a web application that allows users to create and manage a to-do list. The app should have the following features:

1. Users should be able to add tasks to the to-do list.
2. Users should be able to mark tasks as completed.
3. Users should be able to delete tasks from the to-do list.
4. Users should be able to edit the text of tasks.      
5. The app should have a user interface that is easy to use and visually appealing.    
6. The app should have a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.        
7. The app should have a clean and well-organized codebase. 
8. Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the app.
